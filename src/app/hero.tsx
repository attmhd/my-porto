                <br />
                Through my coursework and hands-on projects, Iâ€™ve gained experience in building data-driven models, designing back-end architectures, and implementing DevOps practices to optimize workflows. I approach each project with a problem-solving mindset, striving to deliver secure, scalable, and high-performance solutions. Eager to learn and grow, I look forward to contributing to a team where I can continue to develop my skills and make a meaningful impact.
